# SnakeGame

Now working in Windows 10!

```
This is a "classic" snake game with multiplayer support.

The game is written in C#.
I don't know if the game can run in anything other than Windows!

It's my first C# and .net program (besides a couple of Hello World test programs)
so bare with me if it's clumsy use of the libraries or stupid code.
